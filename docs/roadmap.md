# Roadmap

The project is functionally ready for 1.0. Feel free to try it in non-critical production scenarios and provide feedback in the issues.

The 1.0 release will include the following features:

-   ✅ Strings.
-   ✅ Lists.
-   ✅ Sets.
-   ✅ Hashes.
-   ✅ Sorted sets.
-   ✅ Key management.
-   ✅ Transactions.

✅ = done, ⏳ = in progress, ⬜ = next in line

Future versions may include additional data types (such as streams, HyperLogLog or geo), features like publish/subscribe, and more commands for existing types.

Features I'd rather not implement even in future versions:

-   Lua scripting.
-   Authentication and ACLs.
-   Multiple databases.
-   Watch/unwatch.

Features I definitely don't want to implement:

-   Cluster.
-   Sentinel.
